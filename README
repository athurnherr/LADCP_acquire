=Introduction=

The LADCP_acquire software implements LADCP data acquisition on UN*X
systems (e.g. Linux, MacOSX, FreeBSD, etc.). It consists of the TRDIterm
program, a portable terminal emulation written in perl, as well as a
number of "operator scripts", written in expect. The main purpose of
the software is to provide a comfortable and "operator-error-tolerant"
command-line environment for data acquisition from single- and dual-head
LADCP systems built using Teledyne/RDI and Nortek ADCPs.

The documentation assumes familiarity with UN*X and LADCP data
acquisition. (If you do not know what a UN*X "special file" is or have
never seen an ADCP command file, this software and documentation is not
for you.) While I do not intend to support this software, bug reports
sent to <athurnherr@yahoo.com> are welcome. This [README] file contains
notes on how to setup and use the LADCP_acquire data acquisitions
software for a new cruise. For notes on installation on different UN*X
flavors see [README.*] files (e.g. [README.Linux]). 


=Connecting ADCP Heads to Acquisitions Computer=

1) physically connect the instruments
	- NB: not all USB-to-serial adapters are capable of sending
	      BREAK signals. 

2) determine the special files of the serial ports the instruments are
   connected to:
	- Linux: /dev/ttyS0 /dev/ttyS1 for standard serial ports
	- Linux: /dev/ttyUSB0 /dev/ttyUSB1 for USB2serial ports
	- FreeBSD: /dev/cuad0 /dev/cuad1 for standard serial ports
	- MacOSX: depends on USB2serial adapter, e.g. /dev/cu.USA* for
  	          a keyspan USA-19QW adapter;

3) run "prepare_instrument <serial-port>" (e.g. prepare_instrument /dev/ttyS0)
	- the search path must be set up to include the directory of the
	  "prepare_instrument" script, i.e. it is NOT possible to use
	  something like "./prepare_instrument /dev/ttyS0"
	- this will reset the default communications speed of the
	  instrument to 9600bps and report the instrument's serial
	  number
	- if this command does not work, none of the others will
	- to troubleshoot, you can use "bbabble <serial-port>" but
	  you're on your own there
	  
4) add the special-files and serial numbers to [CRUISE_SETUP.expect]
	- can change other settings, too

5) test everything by running "reset2" and "dir2"

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=Operator Scripts=

NB: Before using any of the operator scripts, edit [CRUISE_SETUP.expect] to
    set cruise-specific parameters.

NB: the search path must be set up to include the directory of the
    operator scripts. It is NOT possible, to use the operator scripts
    with full pathnames (e.g. ./reset2)

Ldir
Lerase

Ldownload

Ldownload_sequential

Lcheck [profnum]
	- no ADCPs required

Lreset
Lstart [stn.cast]

ladcp_send_cmd <tty port> <cmd-file>
			send command file to LADCP connected to specific
			port; this is the command that can be used to
			start a cast on a dual-headed instrument
			connected to a switchbox

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=Interrupted Downloads=

When a parallel download from the two TRDI ADCPs times out or is
aborted for some reason, the instrumnents may be in a state where they
don't respond to the regular command sequences. The following sequence
of commands usually works:

1. Ldir
	This command often fails with a timeout error, suggesting that
	there may not be bench power even though there is.
2. Lreset
	This command often also fails with a timeout error but it gets
	the instrument into a state where they respond again.
3. Ldir
	If this command fails again, redo steps 2 and 3. If problems
	persist there likely is a different problem.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=Colors=

- for dual-headed systems, color is determined by the serial numbers
  listed in [CRUISE_SETUP.expect]: red for the master and blue for the
  slave;

- this can be different to the colors if [bbabble] is used directly,
  because [bbabble] does not know anything about the instruments;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=Problems=

- if downloading is to be restarted the RDI files have to be deleted
  manually;

- all files are downloaded to the directory corresponding to the last
  deployment name; if there are data from multiple casts present in
  an instrument, they have to be copied to the correct directories
  manually;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

=TTY Utilities=

[bbabble]		bbtalk replacement
[ttycat]		read from TTY, write to STDOUT (e.g. for logging GPS
			data streams)
[send_break]		send BREAK to TTY
[find_comms_params]	cycle through comms params to determine baud rate &c
